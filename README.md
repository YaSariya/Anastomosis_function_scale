This web application is designed to assess the functional stability of an extracranial-intracranial anastomosis. Risk assessment is based on the calculation of the blood flow pattern in the anastomosis, taking into account the Reynolds number, shear stress, and blood volume flow rate.

Anastomotic closure risk assessment

Scoring system (0-6 points):
Criterion 1: Flow type (maximum 2 points)
2 points: All Re < 2000 (laminar flow throughout)
1 point: All Re < 4000 (no turbulence)
0 points: At least one Re ≥ 4000 (turbulence present)

Criterion 2: Shear stress (maximum 2 points)
2 points: 1.5 Pa < τ < 2.5 Pa for all vessels
1 point: 0.5 Pa < τ < 4.0 Pa for all vessels
0 points: τ < 0.5 Pa or τ > 4.0 Pa in at least one vessel

Criterion 3: Flow balance (maximum 1 point)
1 point: Balance error < 10%
0 Points: Balance error ≥ 10%

Criterion 4: Pressure balance (maximum 1 point)
1 point: Pressure difference < 10 mmHg
0 points: Pressure difference ≥ 10 mmHg

Interpretation of the overall score:
5-6 points: Low risk of closure

3-4 points: Moderate risk, requires observation

0-2 points: High risk of closure
